About Me
========

I was born and bred in Darwin, at the “top-end” of Australia, where I finished high-school before moving to Sydney to complete an honours degree in pure mathematics and computer science at the [University of New South Wales](http://unsw.edu.au/) in 1996.

After graduating I continued on at UNSW, completing a [PhD in machine learning](http://unsworks.unsw.edu.au/vital/access/manager/Repository/unsworks:1253) at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.unsw.edu.au) in 2006. My research resulted in a new technique for inductive transfer for relational rule learning. During my candidature I moved to New York to work as an intern at IBM’s [T. J. Watson Research Center](http://www.watson.ibm.com/) in 2001 on an application of transfer learning in a text-mining domain.

Upon returning to Sydney, I worked to complete my PhD while working in a series 
of part-time and full-time jobs. From 2001 to 2003 I was a part-time programmer 
for Proxima Technology (which was acquired by Compuware in 2007) followed by a 9 
month stint as a researcher/programmer with the [Smart Internet Technology CRC](http://www.smartinternet.com.au/). In 2005 I started full-time work at [Canon Information Systems Research Australia](http://cisra.com.au/) (CISRA) as a research engineer where I worked with some great people applying machine learning techniques to a variety of commercial problems.

In 2007 I started a post-doctoral position in the [Statistical Machine Learning](http://sml.nicta.com.au/) group at the [Australian National University](http://anu.edu.au/) and [NICTA](http://nicta.com.au) in Canberra.

About This Site
===============

I bought the domain [mark.reid.name](/) in early 2007 with the intention of making it the one-stop-shop for all of my personal and professional information.

In many ways, this new site is the successor to my previous personal site: [Three Words Long](http://threewordslong.com). I intend to eventually move all of the content their to this new domain.

More about the content, design and mechanics of this site can be found in the site's [Colophon](/info/site.html).
