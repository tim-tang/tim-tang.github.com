Eventually this page will contain links to most of the research and non-research
related programming I've done.

Demos
=====
[Mutli-armed Bandits](/code/bandits/)
:	This JavaScript demo allows you to configure and run a multi-armed bandit game
    and plot the resulting rewards for a variety of agents.

Tools
=====
[Feed Bag](/code/feed-bag.html)
:	This is a simple ruby script that parses and normalises RSS feeds, storing 
	the resulting entries in an SQL database.

Other Hacking
=====================
[Plain Text Wiki](/code/plain-text-wiki.html)
:	I extended Matt Webb's original [Plain Text Wiki][] with a few 
	modifications of my own. I use it to manage the content on this
	site.

[ICML Trends][icml]
:	I wrote some ruby scripts to scrape, stem and analyse the last 20
	years of ICML paper titles. Some [interesting trends][icml] turned up. 

[PhD Thesis Template for LyX][lyxthesis]
:	I used the excellent LaTeX front-end [LyX][] to write my PhD dissertation.
	To have the result conform to [UNSW][] standards I wrote a LyX layout that
	adds a UNSW title page, copyright and originality statements as well as
	ensuring that margins, _etc._ are correct. 

[Bibdesk To LyX][bibdesktolyx]
:	To help integrate LyX and the excellent (and free!) Mac OS X BibTeX manager 
	[BibDesk][] I wrote a small amount of AppleScript to push selected 
	citations in the latter to the former.

[Jekyll][]
:	I have contributed some minor improvements (Maruku markup, categories,
	permalink options) to the static blog engine [Jekyll][] which,
	coincidentally, I use to run this site.

[Instiki][]
:	I was one of the contributors to the [Instiki][] codebase. I helped
	streamline and extend the parser that handles the wiki markup.
