Visualising 19th Century Australian Readerships
===============================================

This web page is a companion to a chapter appearing in "Resourceful Reading" by Sydney University Press. The chapter details are:

> J. Lamond and M. Reid, _Squinting at a Sea of Dots: Visualising Australian Readerships using Statistical Machine Learning_, 2009.

The visualisation application aims to present information from the [Australian Common Reader database](http://www.australiancommonreader.com/wp-database/index.php) in a easy-to-navigate and interactive form.

The application itself can be opened by clicking on the following link or the screenshot below: [open the visualisation tool](/files/code/acrp/).
