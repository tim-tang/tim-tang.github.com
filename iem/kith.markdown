This page is a collection of [blogs](#blogs), [bookmarks](#bookmarks) and 
[papers](#papers) and services I use to keep tabs on what is happening in 
machine learning research.

Papers
------

I keep track of papers to read using the service 
[CiteULike](http://www.citeulike.org/user/mdreid). I have also started a 
[Statistical Machine Learning group](http://www.citeulike.org/groupfunc/3808)
there. Please join up if you want to see what others are reading and want
to share and discuss your finds.
Bookmarks

I collect machine learning (and other) bookmarks using the service 
[delicious](http://delicious.com/mreid). Here are the latest ones that I have
tagged '[machinelearning](http://delicious.com/mreid/machinelearning)'.
