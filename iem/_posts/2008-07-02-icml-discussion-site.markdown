A little while ago, John Langford [suggested][jl1] that a discussion site be set up for ICML that allows attendees and others to talk about the accepted papers.

Having played around with various wiki systems and discussion sites in the past, I volunteered to help set something up. As John has [noted on his blog][jl2] the discussion site is now [up and running][icml]. 

The main aim with this first attempt was to provide basic functionality: papers can be browsed by author, title and keyword; each paper has a discussion thread where anyone can leave comments. There are no comments at the time of writing this but I'm hoping this will change once the conference gets underway.

Provided there are no disasters, the site will remain up for as long as it is useful. Ultimately, I'd like to add earlier conference proceedings to the site and ensure future conferences can be added as well. We will see how it goes this year and incorporate and feedback into future versions of the site.

For those interested in the technical details, I used [DokuWiki](http://wiki.splitbrain.org/wiki:dokuwiki) as the engine for the site along with a number of plugins, most importantly the [discussion plugin](http://wiki.splitbrain.org/plugin:discussion).
