title: Upcoming ALT and DS Conferences

excerpt: I'm a local organiser for two upcoming international conferences. This is a shameless bit of promotion.

Two traditionally co-located international conferences—[Algorithmic Learning Theory][alt] and [Discovery Science][ds]—will be hosted in Canberra, Australia in October this year. One of the reasons (amongst many) that this blog has languished recently is that I am one of the local organisers. [Eric McCreath][eric] is the other.

One of my jobs as local organiser is to make sure every potential attendee knows about these conferences. I thought that a bit of shameless promotion would be as good a way as any to bring _Inductio Ex Machina_ back from the dead. So here goes...

Important Dates
---------------
Before I even tell you what the conferences are about I need you to do the following.

1. Take out your calendars and with your most indelible pen inscribe the these dates:
 > **May 12, 2010** --- ALT (full paper) and DS (abstract) deadline   
 > **June 17, 2010** --- Notifications of acceptance sent out   
 > **October 6–8, 2010** --- Conferences are run   

1. Prepare some amazingly ground-breaking paper for submission.
  
1. Book your flights to Canberra, Australia for October _right now_.
  
The Conferences
---------------
Together, the ALT and DS conferences cover a broad range of research areas within machine learning. 

The ALT conference has been running for 20 years and, as its name suggests, its focus is on foundational issues in the theory of machine learning. A full list of topics can be found in the [ALT Call for Papers](http://www-alg.ist.hokudai.ac.jp/~thomas/ALT10/alt10c.html).

The DS conference has been running for 12 years and emphasises the development, analysis and application of algorithmic methods of knowledge discovery in scientific domains. The [DS Call for Papers](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~achim/DS10/cfp.html) has more information.

Invited Speakers
----------------
We are very lucky to have enticed some great speakers, including: 

* [Alexander Clark](http://www.cs.rhul.ac.uk/home/alexc/) from Royal Holloway, University of London
* [Manfred Warmuth](http://users.soe.ucsc.edu/%7Emanfred/) from UC Santa Cruz
* [Peter Bartlett](http://stat-www.berkeley.edu/%7Ebartlett/) from UC Berkeley
* [Ivan Bratko](http://www.ailab.si/ivan/) from the University of Ljubljana, and
* [Ramamohanarao (Rao) Kotagiri](http://ww2.cs.mu.oz.au/%7Erao/) from the University of Melbourne.

Personally, I'm very excited to hear Manfred and Peter talk as they are both fantastic learning theorists and I've been reading a lot of their work recently.

Bonus Summer School!
--------------------
As an added bonus, both of these conferences will be held just after a co-located [Machine Learning Summer School](http://canberra10.mlss.cc/) running from the 27th of September until the 6th of October.

All in all, it is shaping up to be a great combination so if you've ever thought you'd like to visit Australia and wanted a good, machine-learning excuse, here it is.

Hope to see you here!
