The annual [Machine Learning Summer School][mlss] is being held in Canberra at the [Australian National University][anu] in January next year. It will be part of the joint [Summer Schools in Logic and Learning][ssll]. 

From the 2009 [MLSS website][mlss2009]:
> This school is suitable for all levels, both for people without previous knowledge in 
> Machine Learning, and those wishing to broaden their expertise in this area. It will 
> allow the participants to get in touch with international experts in this field. 
> Exchange of students, joint publications and joint projects will result because 
> of this collaboration. 

The Summer schools will run from the 26-30th of January 2009 and [registration][] is open. Note that there is a 20% surcharge for registrations after the 19th of December 2008 so get registering.

I've been fortunate enough to have been given a spot on the [program][]. I'll be talking about some the work I've been doing with [Bob Williamson][bob] this year on analysing relationships between various notions of risk, divergence and information in binary valued prediction problems.

Leave a comment if you're planning to attend and I'll make sure I say hi. 

Hope to see you there!
