I've been attempting to read an interesting [NIPS 2007][nips2007] paper entitled [Estimating divergence functionals and the likelihood ratio by convex risk minimzation][Nguyen] and realised my knowledge of convex analysis was sketchy at best.

Fortunately, [Wikipedia][] pointed me to an excellent [summary of the Legendre-Fenchel transformation][LF_transform] by [Hugo Touchette][ht]. A bit more digging around Hugo's site led me to a great [cheat sheet][cheatsheet] for convex analysis, covering many of the concepts that were causing me trouble.

Great stuff!
