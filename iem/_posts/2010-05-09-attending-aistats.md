Provided there is no further volcanic disruptions coming from Iceland, I will be in Sardinia, Italy on Wednesday for [AISTATS 2010][aistats]. As well as being able to indulge in what I imagine to be great food and coffee, I'm also looking forward to engaging with a very interesting looking [program][].

Some of the posters and talks I'm looking forward to include:

* _[Learning Exponential Families in High-Dimensions: Strong Convexity and Sparsity][kakade]_ by Kakade, Shamir, Sindharan and Tewari

* _[Exploiting Feature Covariance in High-Dimensional Online Learning][ma]_ by Ma, Kulesza, Dredze, Crammer, Saul, and Pereira

* _[Empirical Bernstein Boosting][jebara]_ by Shivaswamy and Jebara

* _[Guarantees for Approximate Incremental SVMs][bottou]_ by Usunier, Bordes, and Bottou

* _[Structured Prediction Cascades][taskar]_ by Weiss and Taskar

I'll be standing by a poster on Friday explaining [Bob Williamson][bob] and my [work][mine] on some characterisations of the convexity of a natural class of losses for binary class [probability estimation][probest]. 

Please drop by and say hello if you are also going to be at AISTATS.
