A [discussion over at God Plays Dice][discussion] had me nodding in agreement: proving a theorem is like playing an adventure game. As Isabel puts it

> You are in a maze of twisty little equations, all alike

alluding to a particularly fiendish puzzle in the text adventure [Colossal Cave][].

Having recently grappled with some tricky proofs I was wondering how they might play out as a piece of interactive fiction...

    You are sitting before a particularly thorny conjecture. 
    Possible proofs lead away from here in several directions.
    
    > inventory
    
    You are carrying the following items:
       A ream of blank paper
       A pencil
       The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality
       Some half-remembered undergraduate mathematics
    
    > look conjecture
    
    You stare blankly at the conjecture. You think it might 
    have something to do with convexity.
    
    > w

    You surf over to Wikipedia and read up on sub-tangents. 
    The notation makes you confused.
    
    There is a lemma here.
        
    > take lemma
    
    Taken.
    
    > e
    
    You wander off to go get a bite to eat and some coffee.
    
    You see a colleague here.
    
    > talk colleague
    
    After explaining your conjecture your colleague mutters 
    that it was probably proven in the 50s by a Russian.
     
    > s
    
    You sit back down at your desk and spend half an hour 
    reading pages linked to from reddit.

    You see an unproved conjecture here.
    
    > use lemma
    [on the conjecture] 
    
    With a bit of manipulation you turn the equation into one 
    involving the expectation of a product.
    
    > use Cauchy-Schwarz
    [on the conjecture]
    
    Hooray! You now have a tight bound on a key quantity, 
    proving your conjecture.
    
    > generalise assumptions

    Your theorem was eaten by a Grue.
