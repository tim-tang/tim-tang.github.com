Welcome to my machine learning research blog.

I'm a newly minted Ph.D. graduate who has taken up a post-doctoral research fellow with the
[Statistical Machine Learning][sml] group within the [Computer Sciences Laboratory][csl] at
the Australian National University.

[sml]: http://csl.rsise.anu.edu.au/sml
[csl]: http://csl.cecs.anu.edu.au/

The plan here is to present for discussion any papers, questions or ideas related to machine
learning. In particular, I'll probably concentrate on my past and present interests, inclduing:
statistical learning theory, dimensional reduction, transfer learning, rule learning and the
philosophy of induction.

As well as being an introduction, this post also plays a second role, which is to claim this blog
as part of my <a href="http://technorati.com/claim/it4v7jtukb" rel="me">Technorati Profile</a>
through the inclusion of that previous link.
