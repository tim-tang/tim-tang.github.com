excerpt: A notice that I've moved this blog to a new domain. Please update your feed readers. 
location: Canberra, Australia

Just a quick administrative post noting that I've moved 
_inductio ex machina_ to a new domain and to a new --- and simpler --- blogging
engine.

From now on, this blog will be located at <http://mark.reid.name/iem/> and
its Atom feed is available from <http://mark.reid.name/iem/atom.xml>.

If you wish to keep following my posts, please update your feed reader to 
reflect these changes. The feed located at the old domain will no longer be 
updated.

The main reason for the move is that I want to consolidate my online presence 
under the <http://mark.reid.name/> banner. As _inductio ex machina_ is my 
main outlet I thought I'd move it first.

I've also switched engines to [Jekyll][] to lower the barrier to writing posts.
Now, instead of going to my Wordpress installation and typing into a textarea,
I can edit my posts in TextMate and keep version history at [GitHub][]. 

The switch will probably mean this site is not as full-featured as the old, Wordpress driven one but, on the upside, it also means that I'll focus on writing rather than plugins and templates.

Welcome to the new site!
