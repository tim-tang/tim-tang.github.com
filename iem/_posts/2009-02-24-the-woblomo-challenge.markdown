I've posted just over 30 articles on the blog since I [started it][start] in
September 2007 making my post frequency around two per month. 

I'd like to post more so I've decided to follow [David Pennock][pennock]'s
lead and subscribe to the [World Blogging Month][woblomo]. The idea is very
simple: 
> Publish at least one blog post every other day from March 1 to March 31. If
> you do, you win. If you don't, you don't.

I have a few ideas and half-written posts to get me started as well as a couple
of interesting papers and topics I want to write about. By forcing regular
posts I'm hoping to not indulge myself as much in my writing, find the main
thing I want to say in each post and just say it. 

Stay tuned for March...
