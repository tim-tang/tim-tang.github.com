I started using the social, "micro-blogging" service [Twitter][] in February this year simply because I had been seeing so much commentary about it — both good and bad. Since then, I've posted [800+ updates][me], amassed over 100 [followers][] and [follow][] nearly that many myself.

[follow]: http://twitter.com/mdreid/friends

What has surprised me about Twitter is how many people I have found on there who are active, or at least interested, in machine learning and statistics. The day-to-day discussions, questions, advice and pointers I've got via Twitter have been illuminating and fun.

In an effort to get to know some of these people a bit better I followed the links they provided in their respective profiles to see what they had to say about themselves. The descriptions below are based only on those links as I don't find Google-stalking very friendly.

So, in no particular order, here they are:
