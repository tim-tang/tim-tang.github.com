Another quick note, this time about the [ICML Discussion][] site I have updated for [ICML 2009][] in Montréal, Canada. 

Thanks to this year's organisers, I was given a list of authors and papers for ICML 2009 and was able to add them to the base I set up [last year][] for ICML 2008. I've made separate indices for [this year][papers2009]'s and [last year][papers2008]'s papers but have bundled all the [authors][] across the two years in together. 

The statistics I have kept for the site since I started it show that there has been a boost of interest since I've added the new papers. I'm hoping that will result in a flurry of comments during the conference as people attend talks and posters. Keep in mind that if you are commenting on a paper [you can use LaTeX][latex] to get your point across.

Unfortunately, there is no notification system in place for the discussion site at the moment so I encourage authors with papers accepted to this year's conference to check the [front page][] of the site regularly to see if anyone has asked a question about their paper. 

If there is any questions or suggestions about the site you can leave me some feedback either here or in the [feedback section][] of the site itself.

Enjoy the conference and the discussion site. See you in Montréal!
