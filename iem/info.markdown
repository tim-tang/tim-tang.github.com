About _Inductio ex Machina_
===========================

[I][] started this blog in [September 2007][start] shortly after I began my
current [post-doctoral][] appointment. I wanted an outlet 
for research-related writing that lies somewhere between my notebooks and 
[published papers][pubs]. 

That means you will find [expositions][jensen], [book reviews][sc], 
[commentary][] on conferences, [lists][], and the odd bit of 
[self-promotion][idr].

Popular Posts

If you are looking for a place to dive in, you could start with my most popular 
posts. These are:

* [Behold! Jensen's Inequality][jensen]---Unsatisfied with the very algebraic 
and formal proofs of Jensen's inequality, I present a diagram that gives a 
graphical intuition for the result.

* [Warning! High Dimensions Ahead][highdim]---A very counter-intuitive 
result that highlights the danger of reasoning about higher dimensional space by 
analogy with lower dimensional ones.

* [Prediction and the Axiom of Choice][aoc]---Some thoughts on Hardin and 
Taylor's paper "A Peculiar Connection Between the Axiom of Choice and Predicting 
the Future"

* [The Mathematical Grue][grue]---Doing mathematics sometimes feels like playing 
a piece of interactive fiction.

Colophon

The posts in the blog are written in a hybrid of [Markdown][] (for text) and
[LaTeX][] (for equations) and converted into HTML by [MaRuKu][] as part of 
the [Jekyll][] engine. 

[My entire site](/) is managed this way and there are more details about the 
design and technology I use at the main site's [colophon][].
