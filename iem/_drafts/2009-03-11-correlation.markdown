Looking for correlations between events is an important part of science as it can be a useful indicator that one of the events caused the other.

Edward Tufte:
> Correlation is not causation but it sure is a hint.

David Hume is largely attributed as first studying the problem of causation. In his _[Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding][echu]_:
> We may define a cause to be an object followed by another, and 
> where all the objects, similar to the first, are followed by 
> objects similar to the second.

There is a common fallacy _cum hoc ergo propter hoc_[^1] which Mark Chu-Carroll over at _Good Math, Bad Math_ has [discussed at length][gmbm]. He argues that after noticing a correlation one should look for a demonstrable mechanism for the causation.

A converse fallacy can be found when incorrectly interpreting [p-values][].

Conversely, there may be a mechanism for causation but no detectable (linear) correlation. [Anscombe's quartet][anscombe]

Causation is tied up with counter-factuals

Larry Wasserman's [comment][wasserman] on Phil Dawid's _[Causal Inference without Counterfactuals][ciwc]_[^2] makes the statement mathematically precise.

Randall Munroe's xkcd comic eventually reminded of another humorous take on the topic of causation. 

Hofstadter in his _GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid_ has a dialogue called _Contrafactus_ in which Achilles, the Crab and several other characters are watching a football on a Subjunc-TV --- a television capable of subjunctive instant replays. They rewatch a football play with increasingly implausible counterfactuals and the Sloth asks what it might have looked like if addition were not commutative.
