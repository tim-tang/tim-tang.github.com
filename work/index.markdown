Research
========
I'm a post-doctoral Research Fellow in the 
[Research School of Information Sciences and Engineering][rsise] 
at the [Australian National University][anu] in Canberra, Australia. 
I work with other members of the [Artificial Intelligence][ai] 
group. As of July 2009, I also work part-time with [NICTA][]'s 
[Statistical Machine Learning][sml] research group.

[Publications](/work/pubs/)
============
I have [published][] papers on topics in learning theory, transfer learning, and inductive logic programming (ILP).
A summary of my recent work can be found in _[Information, Divergence and Risk for Binary Experiments](http://arxiv.org/abs/0901.0356)_.

Activities
==========
Currently I am local organiser for the upcoming [ALT 2010](http://www-alg.ist.hokudai.ac.jp/~thomas/ALT10/alt10.jhtml) as well as a member of its [Program Committee](http://www-alg.ist.hokudai.ac.jp/~thomas/ALT10/pc.html).
I have reviewed for journals ([JMLR][], [PAMI][] and [Trans. on Info. Theory][infotheory]), conferences ([NIPS][], [ICML][], [COLT][], and [UAI][]),
and have also set up a [discussion site][icmldisc] for ICML 2008, 2009 and 2010 and [presented][mlss2009] at the 2009 Machine Learning Summer School.
