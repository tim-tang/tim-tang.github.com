Abstract
--------
We generalise the classical Pinsker inequality which relates variational
divergence to Kullback-Liebler divergence in two ways: we consider
arbitrary f -divergences in place of KL divergence, and we assume
knowledge of a sequence of values of generalised variational divergences.
We then develop a best possible inequality for this doubly generalised
situation. Specialising our result to the classical case provides
a new and tight explicit bound relating KL to variational divergence
(solving a problem posed by Vajda some 40 years ago). The solution
relies on exploiting a connection between divergences and the Bayes
risk of a learning problem via an integral representation.
